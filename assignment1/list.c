 * remain in the list.  Importantly, this function will also need to free the
 * memory held by the node being removed (it does not need to free the stored
 * value itself, just the node).
 *
 * This function will be passed a *function pointer* called `cmp` that you
 * should use to compare the value `val` to be removed with the values stored
 * in the list to determine which element (if any) to remove.  The cmp function
 * (which will be passed to list_remove() when it's called, so you don't have
 * to worry about writing it yourself) should be passed two void* values,
 * `val` and a value stored in the list against which to compare `val`.  If
 * the two values should be considered as equal, then the function will return
 * 0, and if the two values should be considered as not equal, then the
 * function will return a non-zero value.  For example, part of your code here
 * might look something like this (assuming you're comparing `val` to the `val`
 * field of a specific list node):
 *
 * if (cmp(val, node->val) == 0) {
 *   // Remove node from the list.
