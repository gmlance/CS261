This program is a basic implementation of a chained hash table. To run the program execute the Makefile with "Make" and run the output test_ht with "./test_ht". The program will execute the given test cases. free(list) was added to list_free to simplify ht_free. No other changes were made outside of hash_table.c. Not sure who will be grading this but thanks for a great term!
